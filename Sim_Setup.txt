# Clone baxter simulation
1. Clone simulator in robotics_ws/src/ run:
	$ git clone https://github.com/RethinkRobotics/baxter_simulator.git
2. Change directory into baxter_simulator:
	$ cd ~/robotics_ws/src/baxter_simulator/
3. Get pull request to be able to use the simulator in ros-melodic and create your own branch with that corrected pull request in it
	$ git fetch origin pull/130/head:<name_of_your_branch_here>
	$ git checkout <name_of_your_branch_here>
4. You can try caktin_make now in your "root" repository:
	$ cd ~/robotics_ws/
	$ caktin_make
5. It will likely tell you you're missing some stuff. Install the two things you're missing:
	$ sudo apt install ros-melodic-effort-controllers
	$ sudo apt install qt4-default
6. Now run the catkin_make and it should all compile!
	> you might still be getting errors. I forgot if I just moved on to the next step with or without errors.

# Install simulator now
1. Change into main directory src folder and run the following commands:
	$ cd ~/robotics_ws/src/
	$ wstool . init
	$ wstool merge https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RethinkRobotics/baxter_simulator/master/baxter_simulator.rosinstall
	$ wstool update
2. Build source now by running the following commands:
	$ source ~/.bashrc
	$ source ~/robotics_ws/devel/setup.bash
3. Now do catkin_make
	$ cd ~/robotics_ws/
	$ catkin_make


# Run a simulation
1. Source setup script
	$ source ~/robotics_ws/devel/setup.sh
2. Change into simulation baxter environment within main ~/robotics_ws directory:
	$ ./baxter.sh sim
3. Run simulation example
	$ roslaunch baxter_sim_examples baxter_pick_and_place_demo.launch
